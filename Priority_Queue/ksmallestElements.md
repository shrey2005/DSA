You are given with an integer k and an array of integers that contain numbers in random order. Write a program to find k smallest numbers from given array. You need to save them in an array and return it.

Time complexity should be O(n * logk) and space complexity should not be more than O(k).

Note: Order of elements in the output is not important.
