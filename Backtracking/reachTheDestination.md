Given a source point (sx, sy) and a destination point (dx, dy), the task is to check if it is possible to reach the destination point using the following valid moves:

(a, b) -> (a + b, b)
(a, b) -> (a, a + b)
Your task is to find if it is possible to reach the destination point using only the desired moves or not.

For example:
For the coordinates, source point = (1, 1) and destination point = (3, 5)
The output will be true as the destination point can be reached using the following sequence of moves:
(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 5)

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= x, y <= 3000

Where ‘T’ is the number of test cases and ‘x’, ‘y’ are the coordinates of the given points.

Time Limit: 1sec
Sample Input 1:
2
1 1 3 5
1 1 1 4
Sample Output 1:
True
True
Explanation For Sample Input 1:
For the first test case
The output will be true as destination point can be reached using the following sequence of moves:
(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 5)

For the second test case
The output will be true as destination point can be reached using the following sequence of moves:
(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4)
Sample Input 2:
2
1 1 2 2
1 1 1 1
Sample Output 2:
False
True
