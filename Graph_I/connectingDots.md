Gary has a board of size NxM. Each cell in the board is a coloured dot. There exist only 26 colours denoted by uppercase Latin characters (i.e. A,B,...,Z). Now Gary is getting bored and wants to play a game. The key of this game is to find a cycle that contain dots of same colour. Formally, we call a sequence of dots d1, d2, ..., dk a cycle if and only if it meets the following condition:

1. These k dots are different: if i ≠ j then di is different from dj.
2. k is at least 4.
3. All dots belong to the same colour.
4. For all 1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1: di and di + 1 are adjacent. Also, dk and d1 should also be adjacent. Cells x and y are called adjacent if they share an edge.
Since Gary is colour blind, he wants your help. Your task is to determine if there exists a cycle on the board.
