For a given a Binary Tree of type integer, print it in a level order fashion where each level will be printed on a new line. Elements on every level will be printed in a linear fashion and a single space will separate them.

Example:

For the above-depicted tree, when printed in a level order fashion, the output would look like:

10
20 30 
40 50 60
Where each new line denotes the level in the tree.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
10 20 30 40 50 -1 60 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 
Sample Output 1:
10 
20 30 
40 50 60 
Sample Input 2:
8 3 10 1 6 -1 14 -1 -1 4 7 13 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
Sample Output 2:
8 
3 10 
1 6 14 
4 7 13 
void printLevelWise(BinaryTreeNode<int> *root) {
    // Write your code here
	if(root == NULL){
		return;
	}

	queue<BinaryTreeNode<int>*> q;
	q.push(root);
	q.push(NULL);
