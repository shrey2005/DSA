You have been given a head to a singly linked list of integers. Write a function check to whether the list given is a 'Palindrome' or not.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
 Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1sec

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.
Sample Input 1 :
1
9 2 3 3 2 9 -1
Sample Output 1 :
true
Sample Input 2 :
2
0 2 3 2 5 -1
-1
Sample Output 2 :
false
true
Explanation for the Sample Input 2 :
For the first query, it is pretty intuitive that the the given list is not a palindrome, hence the output is 'false'.

For the second query, the list is empty. An empty list is always a palindrome , hence the output is 'true'.
