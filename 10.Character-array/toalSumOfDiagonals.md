For a given two-dimensional square matrix of size (N x N). Find the total sum of elements on both the diagonals and at all the four boundaries.

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^3
Time Limit: 1sec
Sample input 1:
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Sample Output 1:
45
Explanation for Sample Output 1:
The boundary elements are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7 and 4. 

The first-diagonal elements are 1, 5 and 9. 

The second-diagonal elements are 3, 5 and 7.

We just need to add all these numbers making sure that no number is added twice. For example, '1' is both a boundary element and a first-diagonal element similarly, '5' contributes to both the diagonals but they won't be added twice.

Hence, we add up, [1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 5] to give 45 as the output.

Sample Output 2:
273
