Problem statement
Take two numbers as input and swap them and print the swapped values by using the concept of functions and pointers.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Input Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer 't', representing the total number of test cases.

The second line of input contains two integers 'a' and 'b', representing the second number. 
Output Format:
For each test case, print the spaces separated swapped values of a and b in a new line.
Constraints:
1 <= 'T' <= 10^2
-10^5 <= 'a', 'b' <= 10 ^ 5

Time Limit: 1 sec
Note
You don't have to print anything .Just complete the definition of the given function.
