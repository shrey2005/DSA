For a given Binary Tree of type integer and a number K, print out all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of all the node data along the path is equal to K.

Example:
alt txt

If you see in the above-depicted picture of Binary Tree, we see that there are a total of two paths, starting from the root and ending at the leaves which sum up to a value of K = 13.

The paths are:
a. 2 3 4 4
b. 2 3 8

One thing to note here is, there is another path in the right sub-tree in reference to the root, which sums up to 13 but since it doesn't end at the leaf, we discard it.
The path is: 2 9 2(not a leaf)
