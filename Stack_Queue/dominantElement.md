You are given an array A of length N. An element X is said to be dominant if the frequency of X in A is strictly greater than the frequency of any other element in the A.
For example, if A = [2,1,4,4,4] then 4 is a dominant element since its frequency is higher than the frequency of any other element in A.
Find if there exists any dominant element in A.
