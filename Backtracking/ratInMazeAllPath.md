You are given a 'N' * 'N' maze with a rat placed at 'MAZE[0][0]'. Find and print all paths that rat can follow to reach its destination i.e. 'MAZE['N' - 1]['N' - 1]'. Rat can move in any direc­tion ( left, right, up and down).

Value of every cell in the 'MAZE' can either be 0 or 1. Cells with value 0 are blocked means the rat can­not enter into those cells and those with value 1 are open.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10
0 <= MAZE[i][j] <=1

Where 'MAZE[i][j]' denotes the value in the cell of 'MAZE'.

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
3
1 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
Sample Output 1 :
1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 
Explanation for Sample Output 1:
Only 1 path is possible which contains coordinate < (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) and (3,3) >

So our path matrix will look like this:

1 0 0
1 0 0
1 1 1

Which is returned from left to right and then top to bottom in one line.
Sample Input 2 :
2
1 0
0 1
Sample Output 2 :
 [Blank]
Explanation for Sample Output 2:
As no path is possible to the last cell, a blank vector will be returned and nothing is printed.
