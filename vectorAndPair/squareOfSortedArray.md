You are given an array/list ‘ARR’ of ‘N’ integers. You have to generate an array/list containing squares of each number in ‘ARR’, sorted in increasing order.

For example :

Input:
‘ARR’ = [-6,-3, 2, 1, 5] 

If we take a square of each element then the array/list will become [36, 9, 4, 1, 25].
Then the sorted array/list will be [1, 4, 9, 25, 36].

Output :
[1, 4, 9, 25, 36].

Sample Input 1:
2
4 
-3 -3 1 2
6 
0 1 2 3 4 5 
Sample Output 1:
1 4 9 9 
0 1 4 9 16 25
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
For test case 1:
On taking the square of each element ‘ARR’ will become [9, 9, 1, 4].
Now we can sort the array/list and output will be [1, 4, 9, 9].

For test case 2:
On taking the square of each element ‘ARR’ will become [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25].
Now we can see that the array/list is already sorted, so the output will be  [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25].
Sample Input 2:
2
1
5
4
-6 -3 -2 -1
Sample Output 2:
25
1 4 9 36
Explanation Of Sample Input 2:
For test case 1:
On taking the square of each element ‘ARR’ will become [25].
Now as the array/list has only 1 element so it is already sorted, the output will be [25].

For test case 2:
On taking the square of each element ‘ARR’ will become [36,9,4,1].
Now we can see that the array/list is already sorted, so the output will be [36, 9, 4, 1].
