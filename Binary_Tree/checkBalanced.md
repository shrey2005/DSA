Given a binary tree, check if it is balanced. Return true if given binary tree is balanced, false otherwise.

Balanced Binary Tree:
A empty binary tree or binary tree with zero nodes is always balanced. For a non empty binary tree to be balanced, following conditions must be met:
1. The left and right subtrees must be balanced.
2. |hL - hR| <= 1, where hL is the height or depth of left subtree and hR is the height or depth of right subtree.
