You have been given a sorted(in ascending order) integer array/list('nums') of size N and an element 'target'. Your task is to return the index of closest element to the 'target' in the array 'nums'.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 7 ‘target’ = 4
‘A’ = [1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 45]

Output: 1

Explanation: For nums = [1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 45],
The element 3 is closest to the target element , so we will return the index of 3.
Hence, the answer is '1'.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
1 <= target <= 10^9
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
5
1 2 3 4 5
4
Sample Output 1:
3
Explanation of sample output 1:
For nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
The element 4 is already present, so we will return the index of 4.
Hence, the answer is '3'.
Sample Input 2:
7
6 7 11 13 21 44 46
22
Sample Output 2:
4
Explanation of sample output 2:
For nums = [6, 7, 11, 13, 21, 44, 46],
The element 21 is closest to the target element so we will return the index of element 21.
Hence, the answer is '4'
