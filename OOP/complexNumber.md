Problem statement
A ComplexNumber class contains two data members : one is the real part (R) and the other is imaginary (I) (both integers).

Implement the Complex numbers class that contains following functions -

1. constructor
You need to create the appropriate constructor.

2. plus -
This function adds two given complex numbers and updates the first complex number.

e.g.

if C1 = 4 + i5 and C2 = 3 +i1
C1.plus(C2) results in: 
C1 = 7 + i6 and C2 = 3 + i1
3. multiply -
This function multiplies two given complex numbers and updates the first complex number.

e.g.

if C1 = 4 + i5 and C2 = 1 + i2
C1.multiply(C2) results in: 
C1 = -6 + i13 and C2 = 1 + i2
4. print -
This function prints the given complex number in the following format :

a + ib
Note : There is space before and after '+' (plus sign) and no space between 'i' (iota symbol) and b.
