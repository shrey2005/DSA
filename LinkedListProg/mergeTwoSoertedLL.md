You have been given two sorted(in ascending order) singly linked lists of integers.

Write a function to merge them in such a way that the resulting singly linked list is also sorted(in ascending order) and return the new head to the list.

Note :
Try solving this in O(1) auxiliary space.

No need to print the list, it has already been taken care.

Constraints :
1 <= t = 10^2
0 <= N <= 10 ^ 4
0 <= M <= 10 ^ 4
Where N and M denote the sizes of the singly linked lists. 

Time Limit: 1sec
Sample Input 1 :
1
2 5 8 12 -1
3 6 9 -1
Sample Output 1 :
2 3 5 6 8 9 12 
Sample Input 2 :
2
2 5 8 12 -1
3 6 9 -1
10 40 60 60 80 -1
10 20 30 40 50 60 90 100 -1
Sample Output 2 :
2 3 5 6 8 9 12 
10 10 20 30 40 40 50 60 60 60 80 90 100
